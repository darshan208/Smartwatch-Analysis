# Smartwatch Data Analysis and Price Prediction

This project focuses on analyzing the features and specifications of various smartwatches and building machine learning models to predict their prices.

## Project Overview
Smartwatches are rapidly evolving with various features influencing their market prices. This project explores the relationship between these features and their impact on pricing. The objective is

* Smartwatch Data Analysis: Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand trends and correlations between different smartwatch features.
* Price Prediction: Build machine learning models to predict smartwatch prices based on their specifications and features.

## Key Analysis Performed:
* Collect and clean smartwatch data including specifications, features, and prices.
* Analyze key factors that affect smartwatch pricing.
* Build multiple machine learning models to predict smartwatch prices.

## Dataset:
The dataset for this project contains:
* Brand: The manufacturer or brand of the smartwatch.
* Display Size: The size of the screen (in inches).
* Battery Life: Battery duration on a single charge (in days).
* Water Resistance: Whether the smartwatch is water-resistant and to what extent (in meters).
* Price: The retail price of the smartwatch.

## Technologies used:
* **Python:** Core language used for data analysis and model building.
* **Pandas & NumPy:** For data manipulation and preprocessing.
* **Scikit-learn:** For implementing various machine learning models.
* **Matplotlib & Seaborn:** For data visualization and analysis.


## Model Evaluation Metrics:
* RÂ² Score: To evaluate the goodness of fit.
* Mean Absolute Error (MAE): To assess prediction accuracy.
* Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): To measure prediction error.
